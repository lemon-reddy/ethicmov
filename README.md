# Movie blog

## Introduction

I am fond of movies and there are certain movies that changed my perspective towards things. I want to share things that I liked in some of the movies.

## Top Movies

I have also added good movies from art perspective. These are mostly from my personal experience and online rating sites like imdb and rotten tomatoes.

## Movie Perspectives

I mostly write about movies that I liked and made me think differently. I am not a critic and not aspiring to be one. These are my observations from movies and I thought I could share some of these.
