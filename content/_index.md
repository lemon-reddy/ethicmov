I am from Telugu guy and movies as hobby is deeply imbibed in us from childhood. It's very common two telugu people discussing about movies. Some of these movies gave me a new perspective and changed me a bit. This blog is just a reminder of such impactful movies and also movie recommendations in general. I don't watch much of hollywood and my opinions related to those are very limited.

While some of us feel proud about this, I don't feel great about this. Movies were significant part of my childhood and adult life and I sligthly regret on not picking on other hobbies. Nevertheless, this is my attempt to share my opinions and how they influenced me.

I am not a critic and not aspiring to be one. These are my opinions and solely reflect my views, although these are influenced by offline and online discussions on forums like imdb, reddit.
