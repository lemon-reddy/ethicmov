I am a Telugu guy and movies as a hobby is deeply imbibed in us from childhood. It's very common for two Telugu people to discuss movies. Some of these movies gave me a new perspective and changed me a bit. This blog is just a reminder of such impactful movies and also movie recommendations in general. I don't watch much Hollywood and my opinions related to those are very limited.

While some of us feel proud about this, I don't feel great about this. Movies were a significant part of my childhood and adult life and I slightly regret not picking up other hobbies. Nevertheless, this is my attempt to share my opinions and how they influenced me.

I am not a critic and not aspiring to be one. These are my opinions and solely reflect my views, although they are influenced by offline and online discussions on forums like IMDb and Reddit.
