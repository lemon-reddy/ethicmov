Roshomon effect describes how multiple individuals recount the same incident in different ways. Many Indian directors explored this concept in their films. As it suggests, these are mostly drama/thriller movies, where the movie keeps audience guessing. Without sufficient evidence, the truth would never come out unless the director decides to reveal it. Following are the movies, in which I personally find this explored.

# Strong Rashomon-Style Narrative

#### Ulidavaru Kadanthe

Brilliant movie from Rakshit Shetty where everyone has their own perception of the incident and acts accordingly. Everybody is right from their own lens, unlike other movies where one of the eye witness falsifies the truth. Karnataka's culture is aesthetically portrayed. Director has other movies where he acts himself and very instrumental for it's subsequent success.

#### Ittefaq

#### Virumandi
