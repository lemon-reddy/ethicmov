    Synopsis: Released in 2000 and the debut film of Sekhar Kammula with minimal budget and good storyline that's still relevant. It's lesser known movie of the director but won a National Award. The movie revolves around bunch of friends in their 20s confused about what to do with their lives, who were under constant pressure from their dollar earning States peers. There is so much in this movie, that can easily make a long blog but I want it short.

    Movie opens with one of the friends, Ravi traveling to U.S for the same obvious reasons of better lifestyle, freedom and money. At the same time, many of the friends are content with staying in India and make a living here. Gradually, everyone at some point think about leaving to U.S because of the fear of missing out on it and movie showcases how things unfold. 

Things I liked,
1. Actors have very good communication/acting skills and all of them communicated well in Telugu, Hindi and English fluently, showcasing the beauty of Hyderabad and unity in diversity culture of India. 
2. Revolves around upper middle class hyderabad families with whom some of us can relate and there is nothing out of ordinary. Most people go through this and must have already put themselves in that situation at that age.
3. There is less hatred in the movie while asks viewer not to complain and instead do something about. They even talk good about Naidu for the development he had done in Hyderabad.
4. Explains all the possible reasons one can possibly have to go to U.S. and why people preferred going there. Some go to escape discrimination here and win their love, many go to make money and few go for the sake of not missing and experiencing it.
5. Coming to the characters and scenes, Usha's characterization is good. There is a scene, where she explains Seenu not to give up so easily and asks him to fight more, when he fails to crack MBA exam in his first attempt, while reminding him the troubles females go through everyday in this society. Things became better now as of 2023 and will continue hopefully. 
6. Every conversation is so mature and realistic. There is a scene where Raju gets pissed off of newly attained cool American attitude of Ravi and reminds him about his responsibilities as son where they don't brawl on it.
7. Consultants mainly ask immigrants to sound confident as that's more important that having any relevant experience/interests.
7. There is also a scene where son gives an excuse to Father(not to come to India), that justice isn't served for their real estate property but the father wants the case to get settled to prove his son wrong. 
8. There is an inspiring woman character who cares about the people staying in country rather than people leaving the country and strives hard to solve the problems and bring awareness among the people. 
9. Climax is the gist of the movie where that inspiring woman asks Seenu(who stays in India ultimately) to explore U.S for the sake of exposure and come back to bring awareness among Indians and make it a better place.
