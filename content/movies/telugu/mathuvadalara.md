Engaging thriller with unexpected twists in the plot and interesting screenplay, intensified by background score. Comedy is one of it's kind. It's dark sometimes with way too many puns and can only be experienced by watching the movie. Satya played the witty character, Yesu that certainly brings the laughs among the most serious of us. And it's astonishing how they were able to shoot that climax with limited budget in hand. 

1. Babu is a delivery boy, who earns 4k a month (they make more in reality). Unhappy with his earnings, he decides to go back to his home village when Yesu suggests him to rob(`thaskarinchadam`) Cash-On-Delivery(COD) customers by hiding one of the bank notes.
2. Reluctant Babu, falls for it and tries to rob from an old lady, who notices this and starts a fight. In the process, she falls down on the floor and babu considers her as dead. 
3. Rest of the story revolves around how he escapes from that incident, while accidentally becoming part of a big drug racket and busts it.
4. With this experience, Babu realizes the problems with illegitimate means of making money and decides to stay away from those.
