Main lesson: Only love someone when you feel lucky for having them and enjoy their company. Don't fall for the looks, although it's very important to be physically attracted to each other. Support and solve each other's problems and just keep going despite life's ups and downs.

- The actress has done a fantastic job and portrayed the character with ease.
- It's a fairytale and far away from general reality but gives a good feel in the end.
- Both feel lucky for having each other and sorry at the same time for the hardships they bring along with them.
- The climax is good in which the actor discloses their love to the public to gain her back, showing the effort and change to make the relationship work.
- Strong female characterization and these should be the mainstream with male leads supporting them.
- The lead actor's family relationships are way too cool and definitely one of the highlights that makes you cherish.
- The male lead's aspiration to write children's books is unnatural and can only be possible with a supporting family. I don't think anyone can make a good living out of just writing children's books in this contemporary world.
- Sahithyam and Cinema arts will continue to exist no matter what.
