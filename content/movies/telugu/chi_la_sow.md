- Has good screenplay with couple of unexpected situations.
- Good movie with one of the best characterizations of female lead.
- Emphasizes on how expectations lead to disappointment and being emotionally dependant on others is bad but highlights there is no fun without dependency.
- Relationship or marriage is about two lives coming together to solve their individual and collective problems. Don't get into one until you are confident that you can change many things about yourself
- You will like the lead character well.
