Aandavan Kattalai is a new age drama advocating against lies and shortcuts to get things done through illegal means. Story revolves around Gandhi who wants to go abroad through travel visa and settle there as immigrant, to payoff his debts. To make this visa process easier, he gets a passport with marital status as married and uses Karmeghakuzhali as his wife's name. His visa gets rejected but he eventually gets another opportunity to go to London but now has to remove wife's name.

1. Comic works well with Vijay Sethupathi and Yogi Babu doing their job well. Screenplay is good and doesn't lag anywhere.
2. Ritika Singh looks cute and does her role well too. Her portrayal as independent journalist questioning anyone without fear has strong characterization. But she still helps Gandhi and lands herself in trouble multiple times.
3. Gandhi finds a job under dance master(played by Nasser) for the time being, till his next visa process. While working there, he gradually gains hope about being honest and truthful. Eventually, he gains courage to clear wife's name by approaching regional passport office head directly.
4. There is no single incident that makes us feel Karmeghakuzhali fall for Gandhi. He just proposes and she just accepts and they get married in the end.
5. There is a separate track involving a Sri Lankan migrant, where he acts mute to escape from others knowing his true identity. But he reveals himself to police when things start going out of hand and eases Gandhi's and Karmeghakuzhali's life.
6. Gandhi gets kicked out of his rented house for bringing police home in this investigation process and director takes that opportunity to comment on urbanization and employment problems in rural areas.
7. Deported Pandi looks serious, suggesting that it's difficult to survive in any other country as an migrant and there is a rare chance of being successful through that path.
8. Amidst, Gandhi encounters a broker who suggests getting a death certificate for his wife's name and use that to clear. It's shocking to see that broker suggesting such a difficult route to a small problem.
