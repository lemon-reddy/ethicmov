Honestly, I just watched Kadhalum Kadandhu Pogum based on some Reddit recommendations. It is a good movie but I didn't feel anything extraordinary about it, but it has a huge fan base because of the chemistry between the lead pair. I didn't connect because I didn't find a solid reason for them to love each other except for the fact that VJS is with Madonna during her tough time. One other reason could be Kollywood didn't have good rom-coms like Tollywood. This reminds me of RDX in Malayalam, where it seems pretty ordinary for Tamil and Telugu watchers.

1. I liked the scene where Kathir asks Manikandan to leave in the end, as he went through the same experience and didn't make anything out of it.
2. Kathir was there with Yazhini when she needed someone. He helped her through loneliness and gave her courage to attend her defining interview.
3. I also liked the fact that the director didn't delve too deep into the nuances of goons and politics. It would have been a different movie if they had dug any deeper.
