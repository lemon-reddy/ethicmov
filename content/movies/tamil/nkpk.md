Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom, popularly known as NKPK, is an out-and-out comedy and is based on a real-life incident the director experienced. This movie brought more limelight to VJS after Pizza. The story revolves around Prem (VJS) and his three friends when unexpectedly he experiences retrograde amnesia while playing cricket just before 2 days of his marriage. How his friends manage this situation and get him married is the plot. VJS's dialogue delivery is witty and makes us laugh even though he repeats the same dialogues again and again. I can't speak Tamil but I am able to understand dialogues and comedy without subtitles.

There is nothing much to tell, as it should be experienced as is without much expectations.
