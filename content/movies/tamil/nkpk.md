Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom popularly known as NKPK is an out-and-out comedy and is based on a real-life incident director experienced. This movie brought more limelight to VJS after Pizza. Story revolves around Prem(VJS) and his three friends, when unexpectedly he experiences retrograde amnesia while playing cricket just before 2 days of his marriage. How his friends manage this situation and gets him married is the plot. VJS dialogue delivery is witty and make us laugh even though he repeats same dialogues again and again. I can't speak Tamil but I am able to understand dialogues and comedy without subtitles.

There is nothing much to tell, as it should be experienced as is without much expectations.
